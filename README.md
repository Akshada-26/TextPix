### TextPix: Interactive Image Description System

**Repository Name**: `TextPix`  
**Language**: JavaScript, Python, Machine Learning  
**Tech Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Machine Learning, Web Scraping

---

## Overview

TextPix is an interactive image description system that leverages a front-end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with Python-based machine learning models to provide dynamic image descriptions and real-time data extraction through web scraping.

This project aims to bridge the gap between visual content and textual understanding by automating image description generation and dynamically displaying real-time data through web scraping.

## Features

- **Interactive Image Description**: Generate image descriptions dynamically using machine learning-based models.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Implemented Python-based models for converting speech to text for image descriptions.
- **Real-Time Data Extraction**: Use web scraping libraries to extract and display real-time data dynamically.
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

### Front-End

- **HTML**: Building the structure of web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling and designing visual aspects.
- **JavaScript**: Making the UI interactive and handling dynamic features.

### Back-End / Machine Learning

- **Python**: Backend processing, machine learning, and speech-to-text functionality.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Used to generate image descriptions.
- **Web Scraping**: Libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests for real-time data extraction.

## Usage

1. Visit the web application on your local machine: `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Upload images or provide speech input for dynamic description generation.
3. Real-time data is dynamically displayed using web scraping, ensuring up-to-date information.
